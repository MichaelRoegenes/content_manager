### Title: Contact Manager

### Description:

Develop a command-line application called "Contact Manager" that enables users to manage a personal contact list. Each contact includes a name, phone number, and email address. The application should allow users to add, delete, search, list, and edit contacts, storing the data persistently in a file. This project simulates a real-world scenario of organizing personal or professional contacts, integrating multiple programming concepts into a practical and engaging system.

---

### Requirements:

1. **Data Structure:**
    - Use a **singly linked list** to store contacts in memory, reflecting the data structures topic from week 5.
    - Define a `Contact` struct with fields for `name`, `phone`, and `email`, each as dynamically allocated strings (`char*`) to practice memory management with pointers.
    - Each node in the linked list should contain a `Contact` struct and a pointer to the next node.
2. **File I/O:**
    - At startup, load contacts from a file named `"contacts.txt"`, where each line is a tab-separated record in the format: `name\\tphone\\temail`.
    - If `"contacts.txt"` does not exist, initialize an empty linked list.
    - When the user exits, save the current linked list back to `"contacts.txt"`, overwriting the previous file content.
3. **User Interface:**
    - Implement a **menu-driven interface** that loops until the user chooses to exit, using loops and conditionals.
    - Offer the following options:
        1. Add a new contact
        2. Delete a contact by name
        3. Search for a contact by name
        4. List all contacts
        5. Edit an existing contact
        6. Exit
4. **Functionality:**
    - **Add Contact:**
        - Prompt for `name`, `phone`, and `email`.
        - Check if a contact with the same name exists; if so, display an error message and do not add it. Use string comparison functions.
        - If unique, create a new contact and insert it into the linked list.
    - **Delete Contact:**
        - Prompt for a name, search the linked list, and remove the contact if found, updating the list structure.
        - Display a confirmation or "not found" message.
    - **Search Contact:**
        - Prompt for a name, traverse the linked list, and display the contact’s details if found; otherwise, indicate "not found."
    - **List Contacts:**
        - Traverse the linked list and display all contacts in a formatted manner.
        - If the list is empty, display "No contacts found."
    - **Edit Contact:**
        - Prompt for a name and search for the contact.
        - If found, prompt for new `phone` and `email` values individually; allow blank inputs to retain current values.
        - Update the contact’s fields accordingly.
5. **Input Validation:**
    - Ensure the `name` is not empty when adding or editing a contact.
    - Optionally, validate `phone` (e.g., contains digits and allowed punctuation like , `+`) and `email` (e.g., non-empty), encouraging conditionals and string manipulation.
6. **Error Handling:**
    - Check if `"contacts.txt"` can be opened for reading or writing; if not, handle gracefully (e.g., start with an empty list or report an error).
    - Validate menu choices; if invalid (e.g., not 1–6), display "Invalid choice. Please try again." and re-prompt.
7. **Modular Design:**
    - Break the program into functions to promote organization and reusability, such as:
        - Loading contacts from the file.
        - Saving contacts to the file.
        - Adding a contact to the linked list.
        - Deleting a contact by name.
        - Searching for a contact by name.
        - Listing all contacts.
        - Editing a contact’s details.
        - Freeing the linked list memory.
    - Use appropriate parameter passing (e.g., pointers for modifying the list).
8. **Memory Management:**
    - Dynamically allocate memory for each `name`, `phone`, and `email` string using `malloc`.
    - Free all allocated memory when deleting a contact or exiting the program to prevent memory leaks, reinforcing pointer and memory concepts.
  
    - ### Input and Output:

- **User Interaction:**
    - The program runs via the command line, prompting users for input using `printf` and reading responses with `fgets` (recommended for strings to avoid buffer issues).
    - Example menu display:
        
        ```
        Contact Manager
        1. Add contact
        2. Delete contact
        3. Search contact
        4. List all contacts
        5. Edit contact
        6. Exit
        Enter your choice:
        
        ```
        
- **Sample Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Adding a Contact:**
        
        ```
        Enter name: John Doe
        Enter phone: 123-456-7890
        Enter email: john@example.com
        Contact added successfully.
        
        ```
        
        (If name exists: `Contact already exists.`)
        
    - **Listing Contacts:**
        
        ```
        Name: John Doe
        Phone: 123-456-7890
        Email: john@example.com
        ---
        Name: Jane Smith
        Phone: 987-654-3210
        Email: jane@example.com
        ---
        
        ```
        
        (If empty: `No contacts found.`)
        
    - **Searching for a Contact:**
        
        ```
        Enter name to search: John Doe
        Name: John Doe
        Phone: 123-456-7890
        Email: john@example.com
        
        ```
        
        (If not found: `Contact not found.`)
        
    - **Editing a Contact:**
        
        ```
        Enter name to edit: John Doe
        Enter new phone (leave blank to keep current): 555-555-5555
        Enter new email (leave blank to keep current):
        Contact updated successfully.
        
        ```
        

---

### Constraints:

- Names are **unique** and **case-sensitive** (e.g., "John" and "john" are distinct).
- The program should support at least 100 contacts without performance issues.
- The file `"contacts.txt"` uses tab-separated values (e.g., `John Doe\\t123-456-7890\\tjohn@example.com`).

---

### Testing:

Students should test their solution with the following scenarios:

1. **Empty Start:** Run the program with no `"contacts.txt"`, add contacts, list them, and exit. Verify `"contacts.txt"` contains the added contacts.
2. **Existing File:** Create a `"contacts.txt"` with sample contacts, run the program, and confirm they load correctly. Perform add, delete, and edit operations, then check the updated file.
3. **Edge Cases:**
    - Add a contact with an existing name (should fail).
    - Search/delete/edit a non-existent contact (should indicate "not found").
    - Enter an empty name (should prompt again or reject).
    - Enter an invalid menu choice (should re-prompt).
4. **Memory Safety:** Use a tool like Valgrind (if available) to ensure no memory leaks occur after adding, deleting, and exiting.

---

### Extensions (Optional):

For students seeking additional challenges, consider:

- **Sorting:** Modify the linked list to insert contacts in alphabetical order by name, adapting sorting concepts from week 3.
- **Extra Fields:** Add fields like `address` or `birthday` to the `Contact` struct, expanding data handling.
- **Case-Insensitive Search:** Make name searches case-insensitive using string manipulation.
- **Command-Line Arguments:** Allow direct operations, e.g., `./contacts --add "John Doe" "123-456-7890" "john@example.com"`.
- **Enhanced Validation:** Implement strict checks for phone numbers (e.g., specific formats) and emails (e.g., contains `@` and `.`).
