### Title: Contact Manager

### Description:

Develop a command-line application called "Contact Manager" that enables users to manage a personal contact list. Each contact includes a name, phone number, and email address. The application should allow users to add, delete, search, list, and edit contacts, storing the data persistently in a file. This project simulates a real-world scenario of organizing personal or professional contacts, integrating multiple programming concepts into a practical and engaging system.

### Requirements:

1. **Data Structure:**
    - Use a **singly linked list** to store contacts in memory, reflecting the data structures topic from week 5.
    - Define a `Contact` struct with fields for `name`, `phone`, and `email`, each as dynamically allocated strings (`char*`) to practice memory management with pointers.
    - Each node in the linked list should contain a `Contact` struct and a pointer to the next node.
2. **File I/O:**
    - At startup, load contacts from a file named `"contacts.txt"`, where each line is a tab-separated record in the format: `name\\tphone\\temail`.
    - If `"contacts.txt"` does not exist, initialize an empty linked list.
    - When the user exits, save the current linked list back to `"contacts.txt"`, overwriting the previous file content.
3. **User Interface:**
    - Implement a **menu-driven interface** that loops until the user chooses to exit, using loops and conditionals.
    - Offer the following options:
        1. Add a new contact
        2. Delete a contact by name
        3. Search for a contact by name
        4. List all contacts
        5. Edit an existing contact
        6. Exit
4. **Functionality:**
    - **Add Contact:**
        - Prompt for `name`, `phone`, and `email`.
        - Check if a contact with the same name exists; if so, display an error message and do not add it. Use string comparison functions.
        - If unique, create a new contact and insert it into the linked list.
    - **Delete Contact:**
        - Prompt for a name, search the linked list, and remove the contact if found, updating the list structure.
        - Display a confirmation or "not found" message.
    - **Search Contact:**
        - Prompt for a name, traverse the linked list, and display the contact’s details if found; otherwise, indicate "not found."
    - **List Contacts:**
        - Traverse the linked list and display all contacts in a formatted manner.
        - If the list is empty, display "No contacts found."
    - **Edit Contact:**
        - Prompt for a name and search for the contact.
        - If found, prompt for new `phone` and `email` values individually; allow blank inputs to retain current values.
        - Update the contact’s fields accordingly.
5. **Input Validation:**
    - Ensure the `name` is not empty when adding or editing a contact.
    - Optionally, validate `phone` (e.g., contains digits and allowed punctuation like , `+`) and `email` (e.g., non-empty), encouraging conditionals and string manipulation.
6. **Error Handling:**
    - Check if `"contacts.txt"` can be opened for reading or writing; if not, handle gracefully (e.g., start with an empty list or report an error).
    - Validate menu choices; if invalid (e.g., not 1–6), display "Invalid choice. Please try again." and re-prompt.
7. **Modular Design:**
    - Break the program into functions to promote organization and reusability, such as:
        - Loading contacts from the file.
        - Saving contacts to the file.
        - Adding a contact to the linked list.
        - Deleting a contact by name.
        - Searching for a contact by name.
        - Listing all contacts.
        - Editing a contact’s details.
        - Freeing the linked list memory.
    - Use appropriate parameter passing (e.g., pointers for modifying the list).
8. **Memory Management:**
    - Dynamically allocate memory for each `name`, `phone`, and `email` string using `malloc`.
    - Free all allocated memory when deleting a contact or exiting the program to prevent memory leaks, reinforcing pointer and memory concepts.
